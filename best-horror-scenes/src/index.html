      <h1>BEST HORROR SCENES</h1>
      <h2>
        An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
      </h2>
      <p class="aside__description">
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
        most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
        may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
        necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

        Best Horror Scenes is a love letter to the Horror film genre by Brandon
        Durham. Most film clips contain major spoilers, and it is recommended
        you don’t watch the clip if you plan on seeing the film.

            <h4>Salem’s Lot (1979)</h4>
            <h5>Directed by Tobe Hooper</h5>

            Note for those of you that are familiar with this film: No, I didn’t
            choose that scene. I just couldn’t. I’ve only watched it once, and
            even then in 15–30 second increments with sanity breaks. Outside of
            real-life violence (which I can’t stand witnessing) that scene was
            probably the hardest of any scene from any film for me to get
            through. Hell, apparently the actress herself hasn’t ever watched
            the scene all the way through.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note for the rest of you: For the first time in Best Horror Scenes
            history, I’m actually going to recommend you don’t watch this scene
            unless you’re completely prepared and in a place where nobody else
            can see your screen. It’s extraordinarily disturbing, the camera
            work is nauseating and disorienting, the violence is very realistic,
            and there are a lot of flashes of real S&M.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those that are not familiar with this film (if you’re here it’s
            hard for me to imagine you haven’t at least heard of it — it’s truly
            infamous): Irreversible is incredibly difficult watch, and
            definitely not for everyone. Director Gaspar Noé makes sure of that
            at every turn. Firstly, it’s filmed in reverse. The film begins with
            the final act, and each segment you watch actually happened after
            the segment that follows it (yes, he was inspired by Memento, but
            the concept is taken to a whole new level here). Secondly, the
            camera often appears to be hanging from a spring. It dips and spins
            and twirls and swings and wobbles like a dying moth, all the while
            catching flashes of incredibly disturbing imagery (including a shot
            of the director himself masturbating). Lastly, Irreversible features
            what is, in my experience, quite possibly one of the most talked
            about scenes in “horror” film history (while this isn’t really
            considered traditional horror, it is fucking horrifying like no
            other film you’ll ever see). If you can make it through that scene
            without looking away, you may want to consider professional help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Director Gaspar Noé is either the most nihilistic filmmaker of all
            time, or an epic, long-running joke on the film world. He makes a
            point of being controversial and subversive (just look at the title
            sequence for Enter the Void alone). Of making the viewer work just
            as hard as he has to make it to the end of his films. But regardless
            of how you feel about him — and people tend to feel very strongly
            one way or the other — you cannot deny the fact that this film is
            one of the most horrifying and disturbing ever (legally) released.
